Fingerprint recognition is one of the most well known biometrics, and it by far the most used biometric solution for authentication on computerized systems. 

The reasons for fingerprint recognition being so popular are the ease of acquisition, established use and acceptance when compared to other bio-metrics, and the fact that there are numerous (ten) sources of this biometric on each individual.

Using this biometric system namely fingerprint recognition system for unlocking the door with the help of Arduino.
